  <h1>Calzone recipe</h1> 
    <img src="../images/calzone.jpg">

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a calzone that I like to make often</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
    <ul>
      <li>24 ounces prepared pizza dough</li>
      <li>8 slices prosciutto</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese, drained</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1½ cups finely diced smoked ham</li>
      <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced, drained on paper towels</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups marinara sauce for dipping, heated (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Divide dough into 4 equal portions; shape each into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, flatten each dough ball into a flat circle and roll out into an 8- or 9-inch circle.</li>
      <li>Place 2 prosciutto slices on one half of each circle of dough, leaving a 1-inch empty border. Spoon ricotta cheese on prosciutto. Season with a pinch of salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Top with chopped ham, mozzarella slices, and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
      <li>Moisten edge of dough with a bit of water using your fingertip. Fold the empty half of the dough over the filling and lightly seal edges. Crimp the edges up to completely seal the calzone.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle lined baking sheet with cornmeal. Transfer calzones to baking sheet. Cut several small slits in the top of the crust with the tip of a knife to allow for venting</li>
      <li>Beat egg with water to make egg wash. Brush the calzones with egg wash. Dust with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Remove excess cornmeal and grated cheese from around calzones to avoid smoke from the hot oven</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before serving. Serve with heated marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
